# Meals & Sips
Your dinner party prep app!

# Description
The 'Meals & Sips' application allows you to easily plan your next dinner party in a few easy steps. Pick your entree, pick your featured cocktail (or two), and then impress your guests. This application provides you with a fair number of choices, but not too many to be overwhelmed.   

# Importance
Meals & Sips answers and ever-present call; and exemplifies a clean and easy-to-use solution. Many people search online for meal recipes, and often do so by the main ingredient (e.g. chicken). The same is said for cocktail recipes (e.g. vodka). However, an obstacle is created for someone who is planning a dinner party, large or small. One may need to piece together different search results, and often run into lengthy blog posts to obtain a few recipes. Meals & Sips aims to be the one-stop-shop for all elements of a dinner party. Furthermore, the Meals & Sips team aims to add more features that support this vision, but not too many to become too noisy. Future development will focus on the functionality that makes the user's experience even more delightful.

# Build 
Through a team of three, the following technologies were utilized: HTML; Bulma CSS framework; custom CSS; Javascript; JQuery; Git; and Github.
